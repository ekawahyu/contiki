# Conectric Internet of Things Network Protocol


## Introduction
We are pleased to announce the launch of our Internet of Things Network Protocol stack. It is based on [Contiki](http://www.contiki-os.org/), the ubiqitous open source operating system for the Internet of Things. It connects tiny low-cost, low-power microcontrollers to the Internet and is a powerful toolbox for building complex wireless systems.

We have worked hard to develop an easy-to-use mesh networking stack accompanied with proper documentation for you to get started quickly.
