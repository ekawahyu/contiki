# Conectric Internet of Things Network Protocol


## Introduction
We are pleased to announce the launch of our Internet of Things Network Protocol stack. It is based on [Contiki](http://www.contiki-os.org/), the ubiqitous open source operating system for the Internet of Things. It connects tiny low-cost, low-power microcontrollers to the Internet and is a powerful toolbox for building complex wireless systems.

We have worked hard to develop an easy-to-use mesh networking stack accompanied with proper documentation for you to get started quickly. 

## Minimum Hardware Requirements
In order to send/receive messages over Conectric network, you need to have at least one Conectric USB Gateway/Router and one of Conectric Sensors (Temperature, Humidity, Motion, Switch, RS485 Hub, etc). We have published an article on [Medium](https://medium.com/conectric-networks/announcing-conectrics-usb-iot-gateway-sensor-product-86087af7ae57) that allows you to go from unboxing to a functional mesh network with in a matter of minutes.

Please leave us an email at [solutions@conectric.com](mailto:solutions@conectric.com) for questions about low-cost IoT Sensors and Devices.
